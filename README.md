# C-Project
Due to the present epidemic, handling passenger data efficiently had become quite challenging. As a result, there was an urgent need for some covid-19 specialised information management software that maintained an uniform ticket format. So, in order to meet this demand, my partner and I tried to develop a simple yet effective piece of software that operates in a controlled lab environment (IDE) and can accommodate 'X' passengers. Depending on the situation, "X" may be given any number of values that the compiler is capable of handling, such as 200 or 200,000 passengers.

# C-Project
Efficient handling of passenger data had become quite difficult because of the current pandemic, and there was a pressing need for some covid-19 specific information management software while maintaining a standard ticket format. So, for fulfilling this need me and my partner tried to create a basic but effective software for the purpose, which works in a controlled lab (IDE) environment and can handle ‘X’ passengers. ‘X’ can be assigned any number of values that the compiler can handle e.g., X can be assigned 200 passengers or 200,000 passengers as per requirement.
